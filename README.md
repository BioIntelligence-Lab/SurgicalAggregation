In this work, we introduce **surgical aggregation**, a collaborative learning framework for harmonizing and leveraging distributed heterogeneous medical imaging datasets with partial disease annotations in aggregate to train a clinically useful global model. Our framework addresses the critically unmet need for disease label harmonization. While advancements in recent literature have aimed to address data heterogeneity, the current status quo disregards the presence of disease label heterogeneity in medical imaging datasets and is an impediment to leveraging knowledge from these datasets in aggregate. In this work, we demonstrate that surgical aggregation enables each participating client to train a robust, well generalizable model on client-specific tasks using knowledge learned by other clients performing similar tasks in aggregate, while enabling access to a larger set of different diagnostic tasks via the global model. In other words, our framework enables an ad hoc expansion of each client’s diagnostic capabilities while enabling a new client to join and “import” all relevant diagnostic tasks for their clinical application. As AI assisted disease characterization becomes a mainstay in radiology, we demonstrate how surgical aggregation provides a framework for greater multi-institutional collaboration to train large-scale clinically useful models in aggregate, while reducing the barrier to entry for other institutions – a step forward towards bridging the gap from bench to bedside.
