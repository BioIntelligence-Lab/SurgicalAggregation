Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to collaboratively train a global chest x-ray (CXR) classification model using distributed datasets while preserving patient privacy. A significant, yet relatively underexplored, challenge in FL is class-heterogeneity, where clients have different sets of classes. We propose surgical aggregation, a FL method that uses selective aggregation to collaboratively train a global model using distributed, class-heterogeneous datasets. Unlike other methods, our method does not rely on the assumption that clients share the same classes as other clients, know the classes of other clients, or have access to a fully annotated dataset. We evaluate surgical aggregation using class-heterogeneous CXR datasets across IID and non-IID settings. Our results show that our method outperforms current methods and has better generalizability.
