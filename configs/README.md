# Guide to Experiments

## Experiments

**Baseline:** Configs to train all baseline models

**Exp 1:** Simulation Experiments -- Surgical Aggregation w/ FedBN+ vs Baseline, Central, FL w/ FedBN+, FL w/ Partial Loss & FedBN+
- Exp 1.1: Number of clients
- Exp 1.2: Label heterogeneity

**Exp 2:** Real-world Experiments -- Surgical Aggregation vs Baseline, Central, FL, FL w/ Partial Loss (with FedAvg, FedBN [local & global], FedBN+)
- Exp 2.1: iid w/ complete labels
- Exp 2.2: iid w/ partial labels
- Exp 2.3: non-iid w/ complete labels
- Exp 2.4: non-iid w/ partial labels
